Vimoir is a library that can be used to build Netbeans applications for Vim
and that includes an example allowing to hear Vim.

<p> Use the vimoir library to interface a java or a python application with Vim
through the Netbeans protocol.  The application implements the vimoir {@link
vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansClientType} interface which maps Vim netbeans events to
methods.  The vimoir library takes care of the details of the protocol such as
registering buffers with a <i>bufID</i>, managing <i>seqno</i> command sequence
numbers, quoting or unquoting strings, and managing the netbeans socket
connection.

<p> The vimoir library includes the {@link vimoir.netbeans.Phonemic} client as
an example of a NetbeansClientType. The Phonemic client uses the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonemic/">phonemic</a> java library to
make Vim speak the content of buffers or speak operational messages such as
Netbeans events.

<p> To develop a client such as Phonemic, one must implement a class that
extends the abstract {@link vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansClient} class and that
implements the NetbeansClientType interface. Then it is only necessary to
instantiate this new class and to invoke its start method, in order to start
listening on a connection from Vim and to process the netbeans protocol.

<p>The library runs in a single thread of execution. When a time consuming task
(such as opening a database for example) must be undertaken on the occurence of
a netbeans event, this task should be run in its own worker thread, so as not
to block other I/O operations.

<p> A {@link vimoir.netbeans.Buffer} instance is registered to Netbeans on a
<code>fileOpened</code> event.  To edit a buffer from the application, use the
{@link vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansClient#get_buffer} method and register the
Buffer instance with its {@link vimoir.netbeans.Buffer#register} method.
