Vimoir is a library that can be used to build Netbeans applications for Vim
and that includes an example allowing to hear Vim.

<p> Use the vimoir library to interface a java or a python application with Vim
through the Netbeans protocol. The client application implements the vimoir
{@link vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansEventHandler} interface which maps Vim Netbeans
events to methods. The vimoir library takes care of the details of the protocol
such as registering buffers with a <i>bufID</i>, managing <i>seqno</i> command
sequence numbers, instantiating the client class on each new connection request
from Vim and managing the corresponding Netbeans socket connection.

<p> To develop a client, one must implement a class whose constructor accepts a
Netbeans engine object which is an instance of the {@link
vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansEngine} interface. The Netbeans engine provides the
methods to send Netbeans commands and functions. The Netbeans engine
instantiates the client class on each new socket connection, the client class
name is the value of the <code>vimoir.netbeans.java.client</code> property. The
client class must also implement the NetbeansEventHandler interface where are
defined the methods used to process Netbeans events.

<p> A {@link vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansBuffer} instance is registered to Netbeans
by the Netbeans engine on a the first <code>fileOpened</code> event for this
buffer.  When the client application needs to open a new buffer for which there
has been no <code>fileOpened</code> event, a call to the {@link
vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansEngine#get_buffer} method returns a NetbeansBuffer
object, this object must then be registered to Netbeans with its {@link
vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansBuffer#register} method.

<p>The library runs in a single thread of execution. When a time consuming task
(such as opening a database for example) must be undertaken on the occurence of
a Netbeans event, this task should be run in its own worker thread, so as not
to block other I/O operations.
