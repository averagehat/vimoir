<p> Vimoir is a library that can be used to build Netbeans applications for Vim
and that includes an example allowing to hear Vim.

<p> Use the vimoir library to interface a java or a python application with Vim
through the Netbeans protocol. The application must implement the vimoir
NetbeansClientType interface which maps Vim netbeans events to methods.  The
vimoir library takes care of the details of the protocol such as registering
buffers with a <i>bufID</i>, managing <i>seqno</i> command sequence numbers,
quoting or unquoting strings, and managing the netbeans socket connection.

<p> The vimoir library includes the Phonemic client as an example of a
NetbeansClientType. The Phonemic client uses the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonemic/">phonemic</a> java library to
make Vim speak the content of buffers or speak operational messages such as
Netbeans events.

<p> To develop a NetbeansClientType client such as Phonemic, one must implement
a class that extends the abstract NetbeansClient class and that implements the
NetbeansClientType interface. Then it is only necessary to instantiate this new
class and to invoke its start method, in order to start listening on a
connection from Vim and to process the netbeans protocol.
