Vimoir is a library that can be used to build Netbeans applications for Vim
and that includes an example allowing to hear Vim.

<p> Use the vimoir library to interface a java or a python application with Vim
through the Netbeans protocol. The client application implements the vimoir
{@link vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansEventHandler} interface which maps Vim Netbeans
events to methods. The vimoir library takes care of the details of the protocol
such as registering buffers with a <i>bufID</i>, managing <i>seqno</i> command
sequence numbers, instantiating the client class on each new connection request
from Vim and managing the corresponding Netbeans socket connection.

<p> To develop a client, one must implement a class whose constructor signature
has a single argument which is an instance of the {@link
vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansSocket} interface. The NetbeansSocket object provides the
methods to send Netbeans commands and functions. The server instantiates a
NetbeansSocket object and the client class on each new incoming connection. The
client class is defined by its qualified name which is the value of the
<code>vimoir.netbeans.java.client</code> property.  The client class must also
implement the NetbeansEventHandler interface where are defined the methods used
to process Netbeans events.

<p> The syntax of <code>nbkey</code> Vim commands is <code>:nbkey keyName
args...</code>. The Netbeans <code>keyAtPos</code> event generated by this Vim
command is dispatched to the client class <code>cmd_keyName()</code> method
when such a method has been implemented, or to the NetbeansEventHandler
<code>default_cmd_processing()</code> method otherwise.

<p> A {@link vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansBuffer} instance is registered to Netbeans
by the Netbeans socket on a the first <code>fileOpened</code> event for this
buffer.  When the client application needs to open a new buffer for which there
has been no <code>fileOpened</code> event, a call to the {@link
vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansSocket#get_buffer} method returns a NetbeansBuffer
object, this object must then be registered to Netbeans with its {@link
vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansBuffer#register} method.

<p>The library runs in a single thread of execution. When a time consuming task
(such as opening a database for example) must be undertaken on the occurence of
a Netbeans event, this task should be run in its own worker thread, so as not
to block other I/O operations.
