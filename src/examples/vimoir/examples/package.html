This package includes examples of Netbeans client applications.

<ul>
<li> The {@link vimoir.examples.Phonemic} client is an example of a {@link
vimoir.netbeans.NetbeansEventHandler}. The Phonemic client uses the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonemic/">phonemic</a> java library to
make Vim speak the content of buffers or speak operational messages such as
Netbeans events.

<li> The {@link vimoir.examples.Process} client allows to start tasks from Vim
in the background, and to get the results of the process execution in a Vim
balloon when the process terminates.
</ul>
