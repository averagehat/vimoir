The 'vimoir' project
--------------------

Use the 'vimoir' library to interface a java, jython or python application with
Vim through the Netbeans protocol. The application must implement the vimoir
'NetbeansClient' interface which is a mapping of the Vim netbeans protocol to
NetbeansClient methods. The vimoir library takes care of the details of the
protocol such as registering buffers with a 'bufID', 'seqno' command sequence
numbers, quoting/unquoting strings, and managing the netbeans socket connection.


The 'Phonemic' client
---------------------

The vimoir project includes the 'Phonemic' client as an example of a
NetbeansClient. The 'Phonemic' client uses the phonemic java library to make Vim
speak the content of buffers or speak operational messages such as Netbeans
events.

When phonemic.jar is not available or cannot be used (such as when running with
python), the Phonemic client prints to stdoutinstead of speaking.

Note:
Phonemic is a java cross-platform text-to-speech engine for Windows, Mac, and
variants of Linux, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonemic/


Running the Phonemic client on linux
------------------------------------

Follow these steps:

  * install speech-dispatcher (http://devel.freebsoft.org/speechd)
  * install phonemic (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonemic/)
  * check that the phonemic 'phonemicTestApp' application speaks messages
  * optionaly install jython
  * untar vimoir-v0.1.tar.gz
  * edit bin/vimoir.sh and set the paths of JYTHON_HOME (if needed),
    PHONEMIC_DIR and LINUXSPEAKJNI according to your own setup
  * run one of the following commands:
    $ /path/to/bin/vimoir.sh python  # run Phonemic with python
    $ /path/to/bin/vimoir.sh jython  # run Phonemic with jython
    $ /path/to/bin/vimoir.sh java    # run Phonemic with java and jython
    $ /path/to/bin/vimoir.sh         # run Phonemic with java
  * run the ':nbstart' command in Vim to connect to the 'Phonemic' client


Notes on installing phonemic on debian lenny
--------------------------------------------

The installation of phonemic on amd64 debian lenny is not straightforward. Here
is a recipe:

Install festival:
  # aptitude install festival festival-freebsoft-utils sound-icons
  Run festival and check that it can speak messages:
    festival> (SayText "Hello")

Install speech-dispatcher 0.7.1:
  We need to install speech-dispatcher from source because the debian lenny
  version is too old.

  # aptitude install speech-dispatcher-festival libdotconf-dev

  Download and expand the tarball from
  http://devel.freebsoft.org/pub/projects/speechd/speech-dispatcher-0.7.1.tar.gz
    build:
      $ ./configure; make all
    install as root:
      # make install
      # ldconfig
    There is a bug in 0.7.1 that will be fixed in the next version: when python
    is not installed at /usr/bin and spd-conf fails to run, replace the first
    line in /usr/local/bin/spd-conf with:
      #! /usr/bin/env python:
  test speech-dispatcher as a plain user:
    $ festival --server
    $ spd-conf
      ...
      Configuring user settings for Speech Dispatcher
      Default output module [espeak] :
      >festival
      Default language (two-letter iso language code like "en" or "cs") [en] :
      >
      Default audio output method [pulse] :
      >alsa
      ...
    $ spd-say "Hello"
  The logs can be found at: ~/.speech-dispatcher/log

Install phonemic:
  Download and expand the zip file from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonemic/files/latest/download

  Test phonemic (but on 64 bits linux, first compile the jni library, see
  below):
    $ cd /path/to/phonemic/phonemic/example/phonemicTestApp/dist
    $ java -Djava.library.path="../jni" -jar phonemicTestApp.jar "Hello there"

  Compile the jni library libLinuxSpeakJNI.so (not needed on 32 bits linux):
    check out the phonemic source:
      $ svn co https://phonemic.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/phonemic phonemic
      $ cd /path/to//trunk/libraries/linuxLibrary/LinuxSpeakJNI
    edit nbproject/Makefile-Debug.mk and replace twice (substitute <JAVA_HOME>
    with the path to where java is installed on your system, this may be for
    example /usr/local/java):
        -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include/
      with
        -I<JAVA_HOME>/include/ -I<JAVA_HOME>/include/linux/
    build the library:
      $ make
